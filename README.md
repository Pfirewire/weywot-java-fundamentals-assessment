## Problems

###### Remember to follow our [Java Code Standards](https://java.codeup.com/appendix/code-standards/java/) while you are solving this assessment.

1. In the **Assessment** class inside of the `src` directory.

    - Write a public static method named `square` that accepts an integer as
      input and returns that number times itself.
    - Write a public static method named `sum` that accepts two arguments and
      that works with both integers and doubles (use method overloading) and
      returns the result of adding the two passed numbers.
    - Write a public static method named `average` that takes in an array of
      `int` numbers (not a `List`, an array) and returns the average as a `double`.
      (Hint: make sure the average of `[1, 2]` is `1.5`)

1. Create a class named **Person** inside of `src`.

    - The class should define two instance properties of type `String` named
      `firstName`, and `lastName`. These properties should not be accessible
      outside of the **Person** class.
   - Add a constructor method that takes in two strings and sets the `firstName`
     and `lastName` properties based on the passed arguments.
    - If either of the passed `firstName` or `lastName` arguments are `null`,
      the constructor should throw an `IllegalArgumentException`.
    - Write a getter and setter for the `firstName` property as well as a getter and setter for `lastName`.

1. Create a class named **User** that inherits from **Person**.

    - Add a protected instance property named `admin` that is a boolean. This
      property represents whether an instance of this class is an admin user.
    - Write the constructor on **User** that defines 3 parameters: the first name
      for the person, the last name, and a boolean indicating whether
      that user is an administrator. The corresponding properties of the object
      should be set based on the arguments passed to the constructor.
    - Write an instance method on the **User** class named `isAdmin` that returns
      the boolean `admin` property that was set in the constructor.

1. Create an interface named **Greeter**.

    - The Greeter interface should specify an instance method named `sayHello`
      that accepts no arguments and returns a `String`.
	- Change your **Person** class so that it implements the **Greeter** interface.
    - The implementation of the `sayHello` method on Person class should return the following message: 
      ```
      Hello from firstName lastName.
      ```
      Remember to replace the instance properties of `firstName` and `lastName` to display the assigned values.

1. On your **Assessment** class create a static method named `capitalizeRecords`.

    This method should:

    - Take in an `ArrayList` of **User** objects as a parameter.
    - The method should return a `ArrayList` of **User** objects where each user
      object's `firstName` and `lastName` properties are capitalized.
      
     Sample Input
      
     ```
     harry potter
     Hermione granger
     ```
     Sample Output
      
    ```
    Harry Potter
    Hermione Granger
    ```

    Hints

    - Check to make sure that each **User**'s `firstName` and `lastName` property are capitalized
    - If they are not, use the setter to capitalize the first letter of both the `firstName` and `lastName`.

## Grading

A Total of 5 Points are available. One point will be awarded per problem if the provided solution fulfills all of the specifications for the problem. This assessment will be graded using an automated test framework.

**If a class does not compile, no points can be awarded for it.** It would be *wise* to spend the last ~15 minutes of the assessment ensuring that your code is error-free.

## Testing your Code

You can (and are encouraged to) write a `main` method on any or all of your classes to test the code that you have written. The presence or absence of a `main` method will not affect your grade.
